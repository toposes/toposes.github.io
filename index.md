## About

I am a graduate student studying math. I like the interplay between category theory and logic. My favorite adjunction is ∅ ⊣ ✳. Outside of math, I am quite fond of rhythm games such as DanceDanceRevolution.

## Education

- PhD in mathematics, Carnegie Mellon University (2019-current)
- BS in mathematics, Rutgers University&ndash;New Brunswick (2015-2019)

## Research Interests

- Categorical logic
- Homotopy Type Theory

## Teaching

At Carnegie Mellon University, I have served as a teaching assistant for many iterations of
- differential and integral calculus
- multivariable calculus
- matrix algebra
- concepts of mathemtaics

In spring 2026, I will co-teach a course in categorical logic (joint effort with Owen Milner and Corinthia Aberle.)
