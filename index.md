## About

I am a graduate student studying math. I like the interplay between category theory and logic. My favorite adjunction is ∅ ⊣ ✳. Outside of math, I am quite fond of rhythm games such as DanceDanceRevolution.

## Teaching

At Carnegie Mellon University, I have served as a teaching assistant for many iterations of
